Git

There are two part
      1. Head
      2. Branch

      - .git was hidden
      - commit : record the history

1. Make Git focus this
2. Commit this into the history

Stage
      - after add `git add [file_name]`
      - this will be add into history

      [Test insert]

Unstage
      - Before or didn't add
      - this will not be add into history

Base
- git flow can be always separated by the same base
